# LLM Heatmap Visualizer v 1.1.1

Full Attention Head Visualization for Language Models

This repository provides a set of Python scripts to generate **full attention-head heat-maps** for transformer-based LLMs, enabling researchers to visualize how different components of input prompts, system instructions, and auxiliary systems influence the model's internal attention patterns.

By analyzing these heatmaps across all layers and heads you can gain insights into how the model processes information, identifies relationships between tokens, and prioritizes specific parts of the input during inference.

While attention heat-maps for individual heads or layers are common, the unique contribution of this repository lies in providing scripts for full visualizations that encompass all attention heads across all layers. I will initially provide scripts for the 'uncased berta' model, with plans to progressively add scripts for other models.

> **Note**: You'll need to adjust hyperparameters (number of layer/heads) and model-specific configurations in the script to match your target architecture. This code serves as a template for other models other than the 'uncased bert'.

**Why this matters**: Attention mechanisms are critical to understanding model behavior. By visualizing these patterns, researchers can debug biases, improve prompt engineering, and design more efficient architectures. Researchers can modify the input text, model architecture, and visualization parameters to explore custom hypotheses.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `transformers`, `torch`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Introduction

Heatmaps in attention heads are graphical representations of the attention weights assigned by a Transformer model to different parts of the input sequence. They show "where the model is looking" or "what tokens/features are most relevant" when processing a specific input element.

Attention weights are calculated within the attention mechanism and then mapped to a color scale.

Herem brighter (or warmer) regions in the heatmap indicate higher attention weights, meaning the model is focusing more on those specific input elements. Darker (or cooler) regions indicate less attention.

**Quick Start for those interacting with the concepts for the first time:**

**Most common types of attention head designs in LLMs**

1. Multi-Head Attention (MHA)

Concept: This is the standard attention mechanism introduced in the original "Attention is All You Need" paper.

2. Multi-Query Attention (MQA)
A more computationally efficient variation of MHA.
While it still uses multiple query heads, all these query heads share a single key (K) and value (V) head.

3,Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)
Aims to strike a balance between the quality of MHA and the efficiency of MQA.

Query heads are divided into a smaller number of groups. Within each group, the query heads share a single key (K) and value (V) head. So, instead of one K/V head for all queries (like MQA), or one K/V head per query (like MHA), there's one K/V head per group of queries.
Offers a good trade-off, achieving quality close to MHA while maintaining speeds comparable to MQA. It's more efficient than MHA because it has fewer K/V heads overall, but more expressive than MQA because it's not limited to a single K/V head.

Now, considering those aspects of the model you'll be analyzing, the visualizations start to become a bit more intuitive. 
Considering that the following Qwen 3 0.6B is a dense model with Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) design, and also quantized, we can grasp more about the causality of the similarity between the head patterns and gradient curves.
In the BertModel of the script 2, the type of attention head design is Multi-Head Attention, which makes each individual head to have a much more unique attention pattern. While, in models like the Qwen 3 ones presented here, we see the case of much more similar gradient curve patterns among them all.

Another crucial aspect is to understand if the model is dense, MoE or other structure and this element also influences directly on the visualization of the maps.
In fully dense all parameters active during inference.
In Mixture-of-Experts designs the models activate only a fraction of their parameters per token, making them more efficient.

This is a very short summary and I encourage you to research further and develop your own frames and intuitive sense on the issues.

## 1. Python Script - Full Visualization - Qwen 3

Here I utilized the 0.6b one, with 16 attention heads per layer and 28 layers. 448 individual attention heads to be rendered. 
Since each model have its unique set of configurations, for example bigger qwen 3 versions have more layers and more attention heads, so be aware to adapt this when integrating into your frameworks.

def visualize_all_attention_heads(tokens, attentions):
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(12, 12, figsize=(60, 60), facecolor='none')
    fig.suptitle('All Attention Heads from All Layers (12 Layers × 12 Heads)',
                 fontsize=20, bbox=dict(facecolor='none'))

    # Save as transparent PNG
    plt.savefig('attention_heads.png', format='png', dpi=300, transparent=True, bbox_inches='tight')

    # Display the image in Colab

```
**An .ipynb file (runnable directly on Google Colab) and a simpler version of the .py file (with white background) have been added to the main branch.**

The provided script uses `bert-base-uncased`, a dense model with 12 layers and 12 attention heads per layer, to demonstrate how attention patterns differ between simple queries and the ones where the model requires a more complex reasoning.


### 2.1. Experiment 1
1. Simple Query utilized: ``` the sky is blue```

2. Complex Query utilized: ```run a self-meta-cognitive diagnostic```

<div align="center">
  <img src=".github/simple_heatmap.png" alt="Visualization of how embeddings are saved" />
</div>


2:
<div align="center">
  <img src=".github/metacognitive_heatmap.png" alt="Visualization of how embeddings are saved" />
</div>

These differences demonstrate how the complexity and nature of the input query profoundly influence the LLM's internal dynamics, potentially modulating which parts of its attention architecture are most engaged and how information is integrated across layers and heads depending on the task's cognitive demands.

### 2.2. Experiment 2

To further isolate the impact of conceptual complexity from mere input length, I present now a second experiment comparing attention patterns for inputs that have the same number of tokens but differ significantly in their cognitive demands.

1. Simple query: ```Tell me a very simple short story.``` (8 tokens)

2. Complex query: ```Explain the core idea behind quantum entanglement.``` (8 tokens)
